# Clinic Management System

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a Clinic Management System designed to demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The system models the operations and components of a clinic, including doctors, attenders, tools, and furniture.

## Features

- **Doctors**: Class representing doctors with attributes such as name, specialization, and availability.
- **Attenders**: Class representing clinic attenders with attributes such as name, role, and shift timings.
- **Tools**: Class for medical tools used in the clinic with attributes like tool name, type, and quantity.
- **Furniture**: Class representing furniture items within the clinic with attributes such as item name, type, and location.

## Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of various classes to represent different entities in the clinic.
- **Inheritance**: Use of inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes for shared attributes and methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Application of polymorphism to allow different classes to be treated as instances of a parent class.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation of data within classes to restrict direct access to some of the object's components.
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstraction to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
