# Clinic Management System

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a Clinic Management System designed to demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The system models the operations and components of a clinic, including doctors, attenders, tools, and furniture. 🏥

## Features

- **Doctors**: Class representing doctors with attributes such as name, specialization, and availability. 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️
- **Attenders**: Class representing clinic attenders with attributes such as name, role, and shift timings. 🧑‍💼
- **Tools**: Class for medical tools used in the clinic with attributes like tool name, type, and quantity. 🛠️
- **Furniture**: Class representing furniture items within the clinic with attributes such as item name, type, and location. 🪑

## Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of various classes to represent different entities in the clinic. 📦
- **Inheritance**: Use of inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes for shared attributes and methods. 🧬
- **Polymorphism**: Application of polymorphism to allow different classes to be treated as instances of a parent class. 🔄
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation of data within classes to restrict direct access to some of the object's components. 🔒
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstraction to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object. 🕵️‍♀️

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) ☕
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse 💻

NOTE:
In Java, there is no concept of static memory allocation for objects. As a result, dynamic memory allocation is implicitly handled by the system. Java manages memory dynamically through the use of Garbage Collection, which automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

Similarly, in Python, dynamic memory allocation is also handled automatically. Python uses a Garbage Collector to manage memory, freeing up space that is no longer needed. Both Java and Python rely on these garbage collection mechanisms to manage memory efficiently, reducing the need for manual memory management, unlike lower-level languages like C or C++.
