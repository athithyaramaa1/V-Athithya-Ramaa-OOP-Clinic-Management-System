# Clinic Management System

## Overview

This project is a simulation of a Clinic Management System designed to demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The system models the operations and components of a clinic, including doctors, attenders, tools, and furniture. 🏥

## Features

- **Doctors**: Class representing doctors with attributes such as name, specialization, and availability. 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️
- **Attenders**: Class representing clinic attenders with attributes such as name, role, and shift timings. 🧑‍💼
- **Tools**: Class for medical tools used in the clinic with attributes like tool name, type, and quantity. 🛠️
- **Furniture**: Class representing furniture items within the clinic with attributes such as item name, type, and location. 🪑

## Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of various classes to represent different entities in the clinic. 📦
- **Inheritance**: Use of inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes for shared attributes and methods. 🧬
- **Polymorphism**: Application of polymorphism to allow different classes to be treated as instances of a parent class. 🔄
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation of data within classes to restrict direct access to some of the object's components. 🔒
- **Abstraction**: Use of abstraction to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features of an object. 🕵️‍♀️

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) ☕
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse 💻
